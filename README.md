Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client wanted to create a cross-platform application, making their existing web-based app accessible on mobile platforms, including iOS and Android. Their primary goals included maintaining budget constraints and delivering the project within a tight timeline.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I excelled at thoroughly analyzing the requirements and evaluating potential pros and cons. This included highlighting compatibility challenges and proposing strategies for cross-platform development, ensuring the documentation effectively guided the design process.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The structured exploration in the design document allowed me to understand project requirements in depth and evaluate alternative approaches. This clarity helped ensure that decisions made during coding aligned closely with client expectations and project constraints.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the section on platform evaluation to emphasize security considerations more prominently. Integrating best practices for secure coding and addressing data protection concerns from the outset would improve the application's resilience and user trust.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by engaging with their requirements and emphasizing accessibility, performance, and ease of use across platforms. Understanding and addressing user needs is vital because it directly impacts user satisfaction and retention. Neglecting these needs risks alienating users and diminishing the application's value.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I employed modular design principles and prioritized platform-agnostic solutions for flexibility and efficiency. For future projects, I’d incorporate user personas and journey mapping to better align design decisions with user expectations. Additionally, iterative prototyping and stakeholder feedback loops would help refine the design during early stages.
